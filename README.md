# weathermaxspreadapp

A Clojure library designed to calculate the difference between maximum and minimum temperatures and print the day with the highest difference on standard output.

## Usage

Download the project into your local computer. Alternatively you can clone the project by opening a Linux terminal (or Git BASH emulator for Windows) and run the below command:

    git clone https://github.com/abalajoe/weatherapp

For UNIX based users, open the terminal, navigate to the run folder inside the project folder. Next, make the start script executable by executing the below command: 

    sudo chmod +x startup.sh 
    
Now you can run the program by executing the below command:    
    
    sudo ./startup.sh
    
Alternatively (without using startup.sh), open the terminal, navigate to the run folder and execute the below commands:
    
     sudo chmod +x startup.sh
     java -Dweather_file=weather.dat -jar weather.jar
     
    
For windows based users, navigate to the run folder, open the startup.bat file and edit the Java path to suit your computer's Java path. Next, open the command prompt, navigate to the run folder and execute the below command:

    startup.bat
    
Alternatively (without using startup.bat), open the command prompt, navigate to the run folder and execute the below command:
    
    java -Dweather_file=weather.dat -jar weather.jar
    
NB: You must have Java installed in your computer to run the application.
